 * - [PROCESS_ID] The id of the entity in the process.
 * - [REQUIREMENT_ID] The id of a requirement that needs to be fulfilled in order to execute the process. This is
 *   typically an enumeration. An example of a requirement is a confirmation from the end user to proceed with a
 *   withdrawal.
 * - [ATTRIBUTE_ID] The id of an attribute of the process that can be updated. This is typically an enumeration. An
 *   example of an updatable attribute is the speed of an on-chain withdrawal. The concept of hurdles is also used to
 *   capture the necessary information to update the attribute, but an attribute does not necessarily map one-to-one
 *   with a requirement. There might be multiple requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to update an attribute.
 * - [PROCESS] The model of the process.
